      "Content: emissions, yet most building owners have no idea how to minimize their carbon footprint. The real estate industry is responsible for significant global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the energy used for heating, cooling, and powering the building. These emissions contribute to climate change and harm the environment. , Decarbonizing commercial real estate is also significant for economic reasons. As energy prices rise and organizations increase their focus on reducing emissions, energy...\n",

Leclanch claims to be a global pioneer in the field, having used aqueous binders in its for over a decade. , A further benefit of the water based process is a lower carbon footprint, as it uses 30 less energy, which would otherwise be needed to dry, or evaporate, and recycle the solvents. , With the water based production of the high capacity NMCA cathodes, we have reached a decisive milestone in lithium ion technology, said Dr Hilmi Buqa, vice president R D at Leclanch . Until now, producing them using environmentally friendly processes was considered impossible. But, now we have mastered the process. , In developing its new G NMCA battery, Leclanch has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90 , which has the effect of increasing the energy density. The G refers to the graphite anode. Increasing the nickel content allows for the cobalt content to be reduced from 20 to 5 . , Compared to conventional G NMC cells, these high capacity NMCA') with type Document: did not recognize Python value type when inferring an Arrow data type",
