Leclanch claims to be a global pioneer in the field, having used aqueous binders in its for over a decade. , A further benefit of the water based process is a lower carbon footprint, as it uses 30 less energy, which would otherwise be needed to dry, or evaporate, and recycle the solvents. , With the water based production of the high capacity NMCA cathodes, we have reached a decisive milestone in lithium ion technology, said Dr Hilmi Buqa, vice president R D at Leclanch . Until now, producing them using environmentally friendly processes was considered impossible. But, now we have mastered the process. , In developing its new G NMCA battery, Leclanch has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90 , which has the effect of increasing the energy density. The G refers to the graphite anode. Increasing the nickel content allows for the cobalt content to be reduced from 20 to 5 . , Compared to conventional G NMC cells, these high capacity NMCA') with type Document: did not recognize Python value type when inferring an Arrow data type"
