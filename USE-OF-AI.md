## Improving Our Project with AI Tools

We've started using AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in our projects, and they've really helped us work better and solve problems faster. This document explains how we use these tools, what tasks they help with, and which ways of using them work best.

### How AI Tools Help Us

These AI tools make it easier for us to handle coding tasks and fix errors, freeing up time to focus on more important parts of our projects.

#### Using ChatGPT

We use ChatGPT mainly for two things: fixing code errors and coming up with new ideas. When we run into a coding error, we paste the wrong code and the error message into ChatGPT, and it often gives us a solution right away. It's also great for brainstorming new ways to improve our projects, offering suggestions we might not think of on our own.

#### Using GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot helps us write code faster. It's like having a coding assistant that suggests lines of code as we type, which is really helpful for straightforward tasks. For more complex problems, though, we still need to do a lot of the work ourselves.

### What Works Best When Asking AI for Help

Getting the best out of these AI tools depends on how we ask for help. For ChatGPT, being clear about what the error is and what part of the code isn't working is crucial. For new ideas, explaining exactly what we need helps the AI give us useful suggestions.

For GitHub Copilot, it helps to start by clearly writing out what we want the code to do. This makes the tool more likely to suggest the right kind of code.

### Summary

Using AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot has made our projects run smoother and has sped up how quickly we can write code and fix problems. ChatGPT is excellent for quickly dealing with errors and for helping us think of new ideas. GitHub Copilot is great for speeding up our coding, especially for simpler tasks.
